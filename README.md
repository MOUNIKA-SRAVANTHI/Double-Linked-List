# Double-Linked-List
A Double Linked List is a linear data structure where each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. This bidirectional linking enables efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions. This code will help you to perform all the operations that we can perform using double linked list
This Java implementation provides a versatile Double Linked List data structure. A Double Linked List is a linear data structure where each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. This bidirectional linking enables efficient traversal, insertion, and deletion operations.

Key Operations:

Insertion:
Insert at the beginning: Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
Insert at the end: Adds a new node at the end of the list.
Insert at a given position: Adds a new node at a specified position in the list.
Deletion:
Delete at the beginning: Removes the first node from the list.
Delete at the end: Removes the last node from the list.
Delete at a given position: Removes the node at a specified position in the list.
Delete by key: Removes the first node with the given key value.
Traversal:
Print the list: Prints all nodes of the list in forward order.
Print the list in reverse order: Prints all nodes of the list in reverse order.
Search:
Search by key: Searches for a node with the given key value.
Reverse:
Reverse the list: Reverses the order of nodes in the list.
